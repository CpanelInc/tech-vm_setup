--tier=$cpanel_tier:  allows user to provide a cPanel update tier for the server to be set to and enables daily updates
--bashurl=$URL_to_bash_file:  allows user to provide the URL to their own bashrc file rather than using the script's default one located at https://ssp.cpanel.net/aliases/aliases.txt
                              this option can be passed multiple times for more than one bashrc file and/or accept a ',' separated list as well.
